# Time: 5 min

# Export checklist
#-----------------
1.	Start up Kiva (or your favorite Influent implementation), and open a fresh
	workspace in a browser of your choice.
2.	Search for 'Test', and drag the top 2 results into the empty starting file.
3.	Create two new files in the column to the right of the starting file. In
	each of these files, search once again for 'Test'. Drag the 3rd result into
	the top one and the 4th result into the bottom one.
4.	Create another new file in the empty column to the right of the one you
	just filled. Add the 5th search result of 'Test' to this file.
5.	Finally, create one last file in the rightmost empty column and leave it
	empty. You should now have 4 files; one on the left with two cards, two 
	on the mid-left with one card each, one on the mid-right with one card,
	and one on the right with no cards.
[ ] Go to the 'Workspace' drop-down and click 'Export Chart'. A waiting dialog
	should immediately appear.
[ ]	After a relatively short period, the waiting dialog will disappear and a
	file download prompt will pop up. Follow the prompts to save the file.
[ ] The aforementioned Export operation should not produce any errors, either
	in the browser console or the aperture console.
[ ] Now go to the 'Workspace' drop-down and click 'Export Image'. A waiting dialog
	should immediately appear.
[ ]	After a relatively short period, the waiting dialog will disappear and a
	file download prompt will pop up. Follow the prompts to save the file.
[ ] The aforementioned Export operation should not produce any errors, either
	in the browser console or the aperture console.
6.	Go to the directory on your machine where you saved the file and open it
	in your favorite text editor (preferably one that can expand/collapse xml)
[ ]	Validate that the text contains correct, non-broken xml.
[ ] Validate that the text contains 4 data 'column' fields
[ ] Validate that the text contains 5 node 'file' fields
[ ] Validate that the text contains 5 edge fields.

# Import checklist
#-----------------
1.	If you have not already done so, create an exported workspace by

	workspace in a browser of your choice.
[ ] Go to the 'Workspace' drop-down and click 'Import Chart'. A file selection
	dialog should appear.
[ ] Enter the location of the exported workspace and hit Ok. A waiting dialog
	should immediately appear.
[ ]	After a relatively short period, the waiting dialog will disappear and the
	workspace will contain the imported contents, 5 files across 4 columns.
	Read step 5 of the Export checklist to verify that the import is correct
[ ] The aforementioned Import operation should not produce any errors, either
	in the browser console or the aperture console.
