1.	Perform a search for "daniel" to populate the match card.
2.  Drag a the top result from the match card (i.e. "Daniel, Ghana, Kade") to
    the left or right of the match card and drop it on an empty portion of the
    screen. We'll call this CardA
[ ] The CardA should animate back to its pre-drag position.
3.  Drag CardA from the match card and drop it into the file.
[ ] CardA should remove itself from the match card and re-parent with the
    file.
[ ] Since this is the first item to be dropped, it should also create an
    expanded cluster object in the file and a paperclip should appear in the
    left margin of the file.
[ ] CardA should appear as a child of this newly created file cluster.
[ ] The title of the file should change to reflect its contents.
4.  Drag CardA to the left or right of the file and drop it on an empty portion
    of the screen.
[ ] CardA should animate back to its pre-drag position within the parent
    cluster.
4.  Collapse the cluster inside the file.
5.  Drag the collapsed cluster to the left or right of the file and drop it
    on an empty portion of the screen.
[ ] The cluster should animate back to its pre-drag position within the parent
    file.
6.  Look at the match card and drag and drop the top 2 results into the collapsed
    file cluster.
[ ] Expand the file cluster. There should be a total of 3 items in the file cluster.
7.  Look at the match card and drag and drop the top 2 results into the expanded
    file cluster.
[ ] There should be a total of 5 items in the file cluster.
7.  Collapse the file cluster.
8.  Hover over the collapsed file cluster to bring up the branch controls.
    Branch right.
9.  The branch operation will create a new xfColumn (ColumnB) and add the results
    to the column.
10. Look for a cluster titled "Sinapi Aba Trust" (SAT). Drag it to the left or
    right of ColumnB and drop it on an empty portion of the screen.
[ ] SAT should animate back to its pre-drag position within the parent ColumnB.
11. Expand SAT until you find a leaf card. Drag it to the left or right of ColumnB
    and drop it on an empty portion of the screen.
[ ] The card should animate back to its pre-drag position within its parent.
12. Branch right on SAT. Amongst the new results should be a large cluster with 20+
    items.
13. Expand the file cluster and drag and drop this large cluster into the file cluster.
[ ] A dialog box should pop up stating "Adding large clusters to file may take longer
    than expected. Do you wish to continue?".
14. Click the "Cancel" button.
[ ] The large cluster should return to its original position.
15. Drag and drop this large cluster into the file cluster. The dialog should appear
    again. This time click "Add File".
[ ] The contents of the large cluster should be flattened and added to the file cluster.
