# Persistence checklist
#----------------------
1.	Start up Kiva (or your favorite Influent implementation), and open a fresh
	workspace in a browser.
2.	Search for 'Test', and drag the top 2 results into the empty starting file.
3.	Create a new file in the empty column to the right of the start file.
	Search for 'Test' and drag the 3rd search result into the new file.
4.	Select 'Test, Iraq' from the start file and note the contents of the
	Account Details panel at the bottom of the screen.
[ ]	Refresh the browser. A dialog should pop indicating whether or not to
	reload the previous session. Hit 'Reload'.
[ ] Validate that the contents of Reloaded workspace match the workspace prior
	to the refresh. Ensure that the selection and the Account Details are the
	same as well.
[ ] Close your browser, start it up again, and navigate back to Influent.
	Verify that the prompt comes up once more, hit 'Reload', and verify that
	everything is the same as the previous step.
[ ] Finally, refresh the page, but this time hit 'New sesion'. Verify that
	a fresh workspace is reproduced.
[ ] Repeat above tests in each supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, IE, etc.). 
	Verify that the behavior is the same in each browser.

5.	Start a clean workspace
6.	Search for "visionfund"
7.	File the top cluster and don't close the match card.
8.	Reload the page in the browser, choose to reload the previous session
[ ] Verify that the previous session is fully restores and that no errors are thrown
