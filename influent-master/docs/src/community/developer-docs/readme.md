# Overview #

This guide is designed for developers who want to build, install and run the Influent source code to create easy-to-use visual analytics for investigating large custom transaction flow datasets. There are three sections:

- [How To](how-to/installation/) Instructions for downloading the Influent source code and quickly creating your own application.
- [Reference](reference/clustering/): Comprehensive documentation of the property files that control the look and feel and functionality of your application.
- [API](api/container): Definitions of the Container API members used by Influent's views.
- [Database](database/linkflow/): Detailed definitions and diagrams of the Influent tables that store your entity and transaction data.

## Getting Started ##

To begin your custom Influent project, see the [Installation](how-to/installation/) topic for information on installing the necessary prerequisites, retrieving the source code and building the application.
