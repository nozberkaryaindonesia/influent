Getting Started
===============

This topic presents an example Influent workflow to help new users quickly understand the application. This example is based on synthesized banking transaction data.

For a video demonstration of this example, see our Influent AML and Banking product site, <http://influent.io>.

## <a name="analytic-scenario"></a> Analytic Scenario ##

Transaction monitoring has uncovered a substantial increase in activity in accounts belonging to *Jason Walker*. We can use Influent to:

- Investigate the source and destination of *Jason Walker's* funds
- Identify additional accounts of concern
- Discover the nature of the suspicious activity

## <a name="log-in"></a> Logging In ##

Influent is accessible from any modern Web browser (i.e., Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer).

<h6 class="procedure">To start a new session</h6>

1. Open your browser and navigate to the location of your Influent Web server. For the live demo: <http://influent.org/influent/>.
2. Review the Summary tab, which describes the nature and scope of your dataset.

## Next Steps ##

To begin the investigation, access the Accounts tab, which lets us [search for entities](../find-accounts/) based on known identifying attributes.
