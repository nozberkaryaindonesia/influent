Exporting Transaction Flow Data
===============================

Influent enables us to export Flow workspace data in a number of different ways:

<h6 class="procedure">To export filed workspace data to an XML file</h6>

- Select **Export Chart** from the **File** menu.

<p class="procedure-text">Influent XML files (*.infml) can be saved for importing into later Influent sessions or shared with other analysts. <strong>NOTE</strong>: Search results and other unfiled accounts cannot be saved to XML files.</p>

<h6 class="procedure">To export a screenshot of the workspace as an image</h6>

- Select **Export Image** from the **File** menu.

<p class="procedure-text">Workspace images (*.png) can be easily included in reports or emailed to individuals without access to Influent. The exported image shows the selected Transaction Flow period and the entire workspace, including unfiled accounts and search results.</p>
